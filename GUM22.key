! ================================================================
!       The schedule
! ================================================================
!  TECHNICAL NOTE:  This schedule triggers warnings about time lost to 
!  resynchronization at the correlator due to formatter reconfigures.
!  The reconfigures are the result of the fact that the 6cm and
!  18cm setups both use net upper sideband while the first mix in the
!  VLBA system is lower sideband at 18cm but upper sideband at 6cm.
!  The required BBC sideband is thus different, and BBC sidebands
!  are hardwired to samplers, so the formatter has to look at 
!  different samplers for the two setups - hence the reconfigures.
!  This is being left here to exercise the SCHED scheme for warning
!  about resyncs.  But a user might prefer to allow more time for
!  the band switch, or convert one setup (probably 18cm) to lower net
!  sideband.

!  Time intervals (dur, gap, dwell - but not prescan) are in 
!  sidereal units - shorter than UT units by ~1.0027.
!  Start and stop times are in LST for the specified station,
!  which is VLBA_PT for VLBI dynamic scheduling projects.
!  The start day can be specified as the "local sidereal day",
!  which is sort of like MJD, but for sidereal time.  These days
!  are listed on VLA schedules.  The regular UT date can also be
!  used (new feature).

! lst      = TIMEREFERENCESTATION
year  = STARTYEAR
month = STARTMONTH
day      = STARTDAY
! day   = STARTDAY
start    = STARTTIME

! This is a phase referencing schedule with a lot of short scans.
! It also switches between 4 and 18 cm.
! For dynamic scheduling, the key calibration scans should be 
! toward the middle.  Some time could be lost off either end.

! Drive antennas to phase calibrator then start nodding
